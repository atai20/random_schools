        <h1 className="mt-5 ctext-primary">About us</h1>
        <p className="lead ctext-primary">Let us introduce you to Firey - application for high school students. Our aim is to give a tool for extracurricular activities in school, as well as demonstrate opportunities for students in forming and improving their vision for their future careers. Here they can share ideas with fellow students from their own school or club, forming <code class="small">challenges</code> and observing results at the end of month or week. Very helpful feature is the portfolio of a student with their accomplishments and future plans. There you can find clubs students are attending as well as the role in recent events hosted by a club. Also the application along with clubs supports sport activities, we consider this as a very prominent part of our platform.
<br/>As you start learning the basics, let us introduce you to the main idea of this website. Our project not only serves as a tool for schools to help with organization of clubs, sports events and other extracurricular activities but also a guideline for international students as well as helpful forums from those who had the same situation. Here a parent can be sure that no matter how suddenly a student transferred to another school or even just came to the United States, the child will always have a place where to start the process. This way the child will have the same chances as in-state students to get into a prestigious college, without any barriers. With a comfortable step by step guideline for people from all over the World, no matter what language they use.
<br/>As students use the application, they can gather in-site units of progress after accomplishing tasks from their group leaders. Each task has its due date, but they do not have the same importance as homework and are <code class="small">not</code> mandatory. After getting units, students are marked on a day leaderboard of students from different schools according to how much they earned in a particular day. Group leaders for clubs are elected each month, their profiles will be seen for all of the students inside the club. The same works for the president of the school, this way the person students are electing for will be much more transparent for all of the students in school.
(I guess we’ll add this later) Students signing up for clubs do not have to attend all the meetings, but their attendance will be seen for them only in the profile page. Any user including teachers or club leaders can observe the challenges and events hosted by their clubs or sports teams in an interactive calendar. In the main page Students will be able to observe <code class="small">opportunities</code> hosted by verified organizations according to interests of a particular student. The organizations will have to pay fixed fee in order to be on posts page for Students.</p>
